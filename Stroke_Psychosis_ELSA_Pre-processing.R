# Pre-processing script for Richards-Belle et al
#
# This script pre-processes the ELSA data files by recoding variables merging datafiles from
# different waves into a single R Data File (.rda file)
#
# Analysis for study completed on R 4.1.2

###############################################################################################################

# This script is to create the master dataset of data from each ELSA study wave. 
# Wave-specific variables are named e.g. w1depression (for depression from wave 1).

# This script covers:
# - Creation of a master dataset of data from each ELSA study wave (Wave-specific variables are named e.g. w1depression (for depression from wave 1)).
# - Creation of complete case survival analysis datasets
# - Creation of multiple imputation datasets for survival analysis

# Clear memory
