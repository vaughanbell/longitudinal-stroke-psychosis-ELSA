Publication status: currently in [pre-print](https://not_online_yet).

This archive contains the R code for the analysis reported in the above study. The code is presented as a base R script and [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) which are documents that combine both code and the output in a form that can be viewed online, but also re-run and the results reproduced when accompanied by the original datasets.

This repository contains:

1.  [Stroke Psychosis ELSA Pre-processing.R](https://github.com/vaughanbell/stroke-psychosis-national-epi-analysis/blob/main/Stroke_Psychosis_ELSA_Pre-processing.R) - a pre-processing script that recodes and merges ELSA data files into a single .rda file for analysis by other Jupyter notebooks

### Dataset

This study used data from the [English Longitudinal Study of Ageing](https://www.elsa-project.ac.uk/) (ELSA).

ELSA is a "panel study of a representative cohort of men and women living in England aged â‰¥50 years." that is "multidisciplinary in orientation, involving the collection of economic, social, psychological, cognitive, health, biological and genetic data. The study commenced in 2002, and the sample has been followed up every 2 years" [(Steptoe et al, 2013)](https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dys168)

The data can be download from the [UK Data Service](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=5050).

### Platform and package versions

To aid reproducibility, the platform (hardware, operating system), R language version, and package versions used to generate the results are automatically generated at runtime and reported at the end of the Jupyter notebooks.
